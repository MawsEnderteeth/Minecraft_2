# Minecraft 2
The long-awaited sequel to the best-selling game "Minecraft" and totally different from "Minecraft 2.0"

ReveredOxygen said to me, "I have a learning assignment for you, due tomorrow. Replicate minecraft in rust," and I accepted and went to bed. The next day I did nothing but code and about 23 hours after accepting the assignment, I had the beta finished and playable.
And then, regrettably, I didn't give up.
